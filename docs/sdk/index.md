# Vocdoni SDK 

The Vocdoni SDK is a convenient way to interact with the Vocdoni Protocol through the [API][vocdoni-api], allowing anyone to create, manage and participate in voting processes and collective decision-making. The SDK is the primary mode by which developers should interface with Vocdoni - if you think the SDK is missing functionality you need, please [get in touch][chat]. 

### Start by following along with the [SDK tutorial][tutorial]

#### There is also a [tutorial](/sdk/integration-details/census-types/on-chain#tutorial) for using an on-chain token-based census

### Detailed [SDK reference][reference]


## Examples

You can find examples using [es modules][example-esm], [typescript][example-ts], and [vite react][example-vite-react] in the [examples] folder.
