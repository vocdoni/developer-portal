It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options.

Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"Get vote","description":{"content":"Get the content of an existing Vote.

## Get vote



Get the content of an existing Vote. If is an encrypted election it return the `encryptionKeys` indexes and the  package will be codified.

The Vote is identified by its `voteId`, also called `nullifier`. The `nullifier` is deterministic and its hash  could be computed as following (using `Keccak256`):
* For signature based elections, is the hash of the `voterAddress` + `processId`
* For anonymous elections, the `privateKey` + `processId`

As well, on the response, the `voterId` won't be returned for anonymous elections, and the `encryptionKeyIndexes` only for finished encrypted elections.

Height and txIndex refer to the block height and the index of the transaction where vote is registered.

The `overwriteCount` refers to the number of vote overwrites already executed by the user. At election creation  time, you can specify the `maxVoteOverwrites` parameter, which defines how many times a voter can submit a vote. Only last vote will be taken into election final results.
