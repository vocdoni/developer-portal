It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options. To know more about the params of an election and its lifecycle go [here](../get-started/intro#23-elections).  In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"Create an election","description":{"content":"It creates an election on the Vochain. \n\nTo use this endpoint, you will need to provide a signed transaction that has been encoded on the client side \nusing the Vocdoni SDK.

## Create an election



It creates an election on the Vochain. 

To use this endpoint, you will need to provide a signed transaction that has been encoded on the client side 
using the Vocdoni SDK. This transaction, referred to as txPayload, must include the IPFS CID-formatted hash of 
the metadata for the election.

The metadata for the election is optional and is provided as a base64-encoded JSON object. This object should 
follow the Entity metadata specification and includes information about the election, such as the list of 
candidates and the election's description. This metadata is stored within IPFS so that participants can access it.

The API endpoint will verify that the hash in the txPayload transaction matches the uploaded metadata. If these 
do not match, the API will return an error.

Example of election metadata object:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "title": {"default": "hello", "en": "hello", "es": "hola"},
  "description": {"default": "hello", "en": "hello", "es": "hola"},
  // Following fields are optional
  "media": {
    "header": "url to an image"
    "streamUri": "url to a stream resource"
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "choices": [ 
        { 
          "title": {"default": "hello", "en": "hello", "es": "hola"},
          "value": 0
        } 
      ], 
      "description": {"default": "hello", "en": "hello", "es": "hola"},
      "title": {"default": "hello", "en": "hello", "es": "hola"}
    }
  ]
}
```
