It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options.

In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"List organizations","description":{"content":"An **Organizations** is an account with `infoUri` that contains organization associated  metadata. \nAn **Account** instead could be a validator, an oracle, a voter or just someone who wants to transfer tokens. \n\nThe `/chain/organizations` endpoints are related only to the Organization account type.\n\n- Return list of organizations ids.\n- If no page is defined, will assume page 0.","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["chain","organizations"],"host":["{{baseUrl}}"],"query":[],"variable":[]},"header":[{"key":"Accept","value":"application/json"}],"method":"GET"}}
