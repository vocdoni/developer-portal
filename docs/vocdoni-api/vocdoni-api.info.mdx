# Vocdoni API



**Goals and Objectives:** 
The Vocdoni API is meant to be the entry point for external integrators to add voting capabilities to an existing  CRM, customer base and product experience. The API should act as a satellite that facilitates creating votes using  Vocdoni, without the hassle of learning a deep platform.
This API should allow to perform the basic primitives of the Vocdoni Protocol such as manage organizations, voting  processes and be able to vote, abstracting as much as possible the complexity and doing so, offering simple and  clear methods to perform such actions.
Last but not least, the API should be modular and allow further expansion with other independent modules such as  payments, CSPs, SSI providers, CRM’s, etc. becoming a open voting block/”lego” for the Web2.0 & Web 3.0 world.
