## Publish census



Register a census to the storage (IPFS in our case). After this, the census can't be edited. 

You could provide the census Merkle root to specify census publication at specific snapshot. 
See [censuses/{censusId}/participants](census-add-participants)

- Requires Bearer token
- The census is copied to a new census identified by its Merkle Root
- The new census **cannot be modified**
- The census is published to the storage provided (IPFS in our case)
- The new census ID is returned and can be used for querying
- If a censusID with the same root has been already published, the request will fail
