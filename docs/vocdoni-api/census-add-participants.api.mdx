It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"Add participants to census","description":{"content":"Add list of public key/address with its weight to an unpublished census and returns the resulting \n[Merkle Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).  \n\nEach addition will modify the census merkle root creating a new \"snapshot\" of the census at this moment.

## Add participants to census



Add list of public key/address with its weight to an unpublished census and returns the resulting 
[Merkle Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).  

Each addition will modify the census merkle root creating a new "snapshot" of the census at this moment. This 
root  identifies the census at this point and can be used to publish the census at this specific state.

For example, supposing a census with id `0x1234` (random hex string generated during census creation), add 10 
keys will generate specific root for this state, ex `0xabcd`. 

If we add 5 keys more, the resulting root changes, the keys are added and the new census have the first 10 keys
plus the last 5, with a resulting root of `0xffff`. 

So, at [publishing moment](census-publish), you could specify no root to publish census on the last 
state (`0xffff`), which will publish the first 10 plus the last 5. Or either specify the snapshot point which 
you want to publish the census, for example `0x1234`, which will publish just the first 10th.
       
- Requires Bearer token 
- Adds a list of wallet public key or wallet address to a census with a specific weight
- If the weight parameter is missing, weight=1 is considered
