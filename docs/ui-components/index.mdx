# UI Components

Chakra ui components for easily integrating Vocdoni services.

## Installing

You'll first need to have a project with chakra installed and configured. Follow
their [official documentation][chakra getting started] in order to do so.

After that, you can add the required vocdoni components dependencies:

~~~bash
yarn add @vocdoni/sdk @vocdoni/chakra-components react-markdown remark-gfm
~~~

## Usage

The very first step is to add the `<ClientProvider />` as a wrapper of your
application or your election components. The `signer` is the wallet belonging to the organization or voter you with to use to interact with elections. 

~~~tsx
import { ClientProvider } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

const App = () => {
  const signer = /* any ethers based signer */
  return (
    <ClientProvider env='stg' signer={signer}>
      {/* your actual app code */}
    </ClientProvider>
  )
}
~~~

Note `env` can be any of the [Vocdoni Environments][sdk environments], either in string format or using the SDK `EnvOptions` enum.

After that, the easiest way to integrate a voting process would be to just import the
`Election` component and specify an election id:

~~~tsx
import { Election } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

const CustomVoteComponent = () => {
  return <Election id='your-election-id' />
}
~~~

This will automatically instantiate the Election Provider with all the available voting components. You can style it following the [theming instructions][theming]. You can also create your own vote view, based on the components used by the `Election` component, and style it directly with props:

~~~tsx
import {
  ElectionProvider,
  ElectionTitle,
  ElectionSchedule,
  ElectionStatusBadge,
  ElectionDescription,
  HR,
  ElectionQuestions,
} from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

const CustomVoteComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ElectionProvider id='your-election-id' fetchCensus={true}>
      <ElectionHeader />
      <ElectionTitle
        p={5}
        mt={6}
        mb={8}
        textColor='red'
      />
      <ElectionSchedule textTransform='uppercase' />
      <ElectionStatusBadge variant='solid' colorScheme='teal' />
      <ElectionDescription fontFamily='monospace' />
      <HR />
      <ElectionQuestions />
    </ElectionProvider>
  )
}
~~~

## Theming

Since these components use chakra's theming system, they can be styled in the same way as [described in the Chakra documentation][chakra theming], but using the custom theme components we defined (see [theming components] for more details).

In order to start styling the voting components, you should use the `ChakraProvider`, and customize the theme:

~~~tsx
// this can be imported from '@chakra-ui/react' too, but that's more generic
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/system'
import { theme } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

export const App = () => (
  <ChakraProvider theme={extendTheme(theme)}>
    {/* YOUR APP CONTENTS */}
  </ChakraProvider>
)
~~~

As you can see, we're importing a custom defined theme from `@vocdoni/chakra-components`, but at the same time, we're using `extendTheme`. This is in order to avoid using base chakra theme, both to avoid a bigger bundle size and to ensure we don't unexpectedly overwrite styles.

The above example is the easiest way to get all the default styles up and running, but you can always define your own entire theme and ignore our base styles.
The [components structure] section describes how our components are styled with more granular detail.

In case you want to add the voting components to a page and ensure chakra-ui will not affect your existing theme, you may need to pass `resetCSS={false}` as a component prop: 

~~~tsx
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/system'
import { theme } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

export const App = () => (
  <ChakraProvider resetCSS={false} theme={extendTheme(theme)}>
    {/* YOUR APP CONTENTS */}
  </ChakraProvider>
)
~~~

If you want to extend or change the theme, you can pass your changes as a second
argument to `extendTheme`:

~~~tsx
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { theme as vtheme } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

const theme = extendTheme(vtheme, {
  // any theme changes would go here
  components: {
    // [...]
  },
})

export const App = () => (
  <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
    {/* YOUR APP CONTENTS */}
  </ChakraProvider>
)
~~~

You can perfectly ignore our styles and write them from the ground up.

### Theming components

For each of the election components we provide, you can follow the official Chakra documentation on how to customize component styles.

Here's a small example of custom theme for the title and image of an election:

~~~ts
import { extendTheme, ComponentSingleStyleConfig } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { theme as vtheme } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

const ElectionTitle : ComponentsStyleConfig = {
  baseStyle: {
    paddingTop: '.5em',
    position: 'relative',
    marginTop: '-2.5em',
    background: 'linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.50) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 100%)',
  }
}

const ElectionHeader : ComponentsStyleConfig = {
  baseStyle: {
    minHeight: '3em'
  }
}

const theme = extendTheme(vtheme, {
  components: {
    ElectionTitle,
    ElectionHeader,
  },
})

// this theme would then be used directly in your ChakraProvider instance
export default theme
~~~

#### Styling via props

All components have all the features you would expect from a chakra component,
meaning you can style all components via component props too:

~~~tsx live
  <ElectionProvider id='4ae20a8eb4caa2f2508be2538decb9648bd9fab41f1d5a549a42020000000000'>
    <ElectionHeader
      borderRadius="full"
      boxSize="100px"

      src="https://picsum.photos/200"
      alt="random image"
    />
    <ElectionTitle
      as='h2'
      fontSize='50px'
    />
  </ElectionProvider>
~~~

You can also use component props much more extensively. For example, here is a more attractive organization pane styled with props:

```jsx live
<p>
<OrganizationHeader/>
<Flex
      flexDirection={{ base: 'column', lg: 'row' }}
      alignItems={{ base: 'center', lg: 'start' }}
      gap={{ base: 2, lg: 8 }}
      mb={10}
      pt={10}
    >
      <Box flex='1 1 10%' minW={40}>
        <AspectRatio ratio={1.25 / 1} maxW={56}>
          <OrganizationAvatar
            mx='auto'
          />
        </AspectRatio>
      </Box>

      <Flex
        flex='1 1 80%'
        justifyContent='space-between'
        alignItems={{ base: 'center', lg: 'start' }}
        flexDirection={{ base: 'column', lg: 'row' }}
        gap={{ base: 2 }}
        minW={0}
        maxW='100%'
      >
        <Flex
          flex='1 1 100%'
          direction='column'
          justifyContent={{ lg: 'space-between' }}
          alignItems={{ base: 'center', lg: 'start' }}
          gap={2}
          order={{ base: 2, lg: 0 }}
        >
          <Flex
            w='100%'
            flexDirection='row'
            justifyContent='space-between'
            alignItems='center'
            sx={{
              p: {
                noOfLines: 'none',
                overflow: 'hidden',
                display: '-webkit-box',
                WebkitBoxOrient: 'vertical',
                WebkitLineClamp: 'var(--chakra-line-clamp)',
              },
            }}
          >
            <OrganizationName
              as='p'
              fontSize={32}
              lineHeight={1.5}
              maxW={{ base: '250px', sm: '300px', sm2: '350px', md: '450px', lg: '370px', lg2: '500px', xl: '650px' }}
            />
          </Flex>
            <OrganizationDescription fontSize='lg' lineHeight={1.7} />
        </Flex>
      </Flex>
    </Flex>
</p>
```

#### Theming complex multipart components

Some components, like `ElectionQuestions`, follow a multipart component structure. Please refer to the [official chakra documentation][multipart components] for more info on how to style this type of component.

Here's a small example of styling the `ElectionQuestions` component:

~~~ts
import { extendTheme, createMultiStyleConfigHelpers } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { theme as vtheme, questionsAnatomy } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components'

const { defineMultiStyleConfig, definePartsStyle } = createMultiStyleConfigHelpers(questionsAnatomy)

const ElectionQuestions = defineMultiStyleConfig({
  baseStyle: definePartsStyle({
    title: {
      color: 'lightblue',
    },
    description: {
      color: 'lightgreen',
    }
  }),
})

const theme = extendTheme(vtheme, {
  components: {
    ElectionQuestions,
  },
})

// this theme would then be used directly in your ChakraProvider instance
export default theme
~~~

You can check out each component's anatomy by checking
[their theme files][theme path].

### i18n

In order to change any of the texts contained in `@vocdoni/chakra-components`,
you must specify the translations for each language in the ClientProvider:

~~~tsx
const translationsObject = {
  en: {
    // all english translations
  },
  ca: {
    // catalan translations
  }
}
<ClientProvider translations={translationsObject} />
~~~
