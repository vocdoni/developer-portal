# Election Components

## Election Component

While individual election components can be used, the `Election` component provides all of the components in a single group. This is provided for ease of use but allows for less customization than the use of individual components. The Election component does not need to be used with an `ElectionProvider`.

```jsx live 
<Election id={'4ae20a8eb4caa2f2508be2538decb9648bd9fab41f1d5a549a42020000000000'}/>
```

## Election provider

To use election components you have to wrap them with the `ElectionProvider` and `ClientProvider`. 

```jsx
<ClientProvider signer={signer}>
      <ElectionProvider id='your-election-id' fetchCensus={true}>
            <ElectionHeader />
            <ElectionTitle />
            <ElectionSchedule textTransform='uppercase' />
            <ElectionStatusBadge variant='solid' colorScheme='teal' />
            <ElectionDescription fontFamily='monospace' />
            <ElectionQuestions />
      </ElectionProvider>
</ClientProvider>
```


::: info election provider
If you specify an election ID, the provider will fetch the election for you. You can alternatively directly pass an `election` object to the `ElectionProvider` constructor. This is useful if you want to render a list of elections whose data you already have.
:::

:::warning
If voting with a non-CSP census, you need to set `fetchCensus={true}` for the `ElectionProvider`
:::

The `ElectionActions` component also need to be wrapped with the `ActionsProvider`:

```jsx
<ActionsProvider>
      <ElectionActions />
</ActionsProvider>
```


## Election Header

Show an election's header image.

```jsx live
<ElectionHeader />
```

## Election Title

Show an election's title.

```jsx live
<ElectionTitle />
```

## Election Description

Show an election's description.

```jsx live
<ElectionDescription fontFamily='monospace' />
```

## Election Schedule

Show an election's voting period. You can specify date format using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v2.30.0/docs/format) format

```jsx live
<ElectionSchedule format={'d-L-y HH:mm'} />
```

## Election Status Badge

Shows the status badge for an election. Possible values are defined by [`ElectionStatus`](/sdk/reference/enums/electionstatus) from `@vocdoni/sdk`:
`PROCESS_UNKNOWN`, `UPCOMING`, `ONGOING`, `ENDED`, `CANCELED`, `PAUSED`, `RESULTS`

```jsx live
<ElectionStatusBadge variant='solid' colorScheme='teal' />
```

The `ElectionStatusBadge` is styled leveraging the capabilities of the Chakra styling system [`tag`](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/tag) component. By adjusting the `colorScheme` property, you can easily alter the color of the badge based on the election status. If no color scheme is set, the [default color scheme]((https://github.com/vocdoni/ui-components/blob/2ca7942/packages/chakra-components/src/components/Election/StatusBadge.tsx#L12-L24)) adjusts tag color based on the election status.

## Election Questions

Show the questions for an election.

```jsx live
<ElectionQuestions
  onInvalid={(errors) => console.error(errors)}
  confirmContents={(questions, answers) => (
    <>
      <p>Customizing contents is quite easy</p>
      <QuestionsConfirmation questions={questions} answers={values} />
    </>
  )}
/>
```

:::info

This component renders **Markdown** text in the question descriptions.

## Election Results

```jsx live
<ElectionResults />
```

## Election Actions
