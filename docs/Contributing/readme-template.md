# Readme Template

Please use this template when creating readme files for new Vocdoni repositories. This is meant to serve as a guide, rather than a rigid rule; adapt it as necessary. Replace all the instances of `REPO_NAME` with the name of your repository, and fill-in the contents of every `\[bracketed\] item. If you add new sections, make sure to update the table of contents. 
:::note
Some features are displayed differently on this site than they will be when rendered as standard markdown. For example, the following logo and badges are centered when displayed on Github.

## Contributing 


While we welcome contributions from the community, we do not track all of our issues on Github and we may not have the resources to onboard developers and review complex pull requests. That being said, there are multiple ways you can get involved with the project. 

- If you have a simple bug or feature request, please submit an issue. We have many repositories, so please try to submit your issue to the relevant code base (eg. protocol feature request => [vocdoni-node](https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-node), UI integration bugs => [ui-components](https://github.com/vocdoni/ui-components)). 
- For simpler and more accessible contributions that should be possible without much onboarding, search this repo and others for issues that have the [help-wanted](https://github.com/vocdoni/REPO_NAME/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [good-first-issue](https://github.com/vocdoni/REPO_NAME/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tags. 
    - Fork the Project
    - Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/yourFeature`)
    - Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some yourFeature'`)
    - Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/yourFeature`)
    - Open a Pull Request
- For more complex feature requests, or if you would like to contribute further, please reach out on our [discord](https://chat.vocdoni.io) support channel.
