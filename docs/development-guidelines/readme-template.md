# Readme Template

Please use this template when creating readme files for new Vocdoni repositories. This is meant to serve as a guide, rather than a rigid rule; adapt it as necessary. Replace all the instances of `REPO_NAME` with the name of your repository, and fill-in the contents of every `\[bracketed\] item. If you add new sections, make sure to update the table of contents.

***Make sure to replace the `REPO_NAME` placeholders in the repo-specific badge links***

**Note:**
Some features are displayed differently on the developer portal than they are when rendered as standard markdown. For example, the following logo and badges are centered when displayed on Github.

### Everything after this line is the readme template:
