# Weighted voting

Weighted voting is a voting system where each voter is assigned a specific weight or value that reflects their relative 
influence or importance in the decision-making process.

When votes are cast, the value of each individualâ€™s vote is multiplied by their assigned weight, resulting in a weighted 
score. The sum of all the weighted scores determines the outcome of the vote. This system allows for a more nuanced 
representation of voting power and can reflect the hierarchical structure or distribution of authority within the 
organization.

## Setting up the election

The process creation anb use of the ballot protocol is the same as on any other Election, the key difference is the
use of a `WeightedCensus` instead of a `PlainCensus`.

Note that Contrary to quadratic voting, the `costFromWeight` attribute in the vote type needs to be set to false or
left undefined in this context.

Essentially, you can use the SDK for any vote type except quadratic voting (which already uses the weighted census
but for different objectives).

The votes are stored on the blockchain like any other voting process. When the results are retrieved from the API,
the indexer applies the weight to every vote, and this reflects in the results matrix.

### Creating a `WeightedCensus`

Following de above example, we are going to create a census where the weight is related to the position of the voter on 
the participants array.

The process of generate a `WeightedCensus` is similar to create a `PlainCensus` with the difference that you have to
add the vote weight to every participant. As shown below, we are giving to each voter a weight associated to its
position on an array. For 4 voters, the first one will have a weight of 1, and the last will have 4.

```ts
  const census = new WeightedCensus();
  census.add(
    participants.map((participant, index) => ({
      key: participant.address,
      weight: BigInt(index + 1), // Give the weight to each participant
    }))
  );
```

## Casting a vote

For instance, consider that 4 voters have to vote on the question: "Do you like chocolate?" with possible answers "yes" and "no".
The weight distribution and votes are as follows:

- Voter 1: Weight = 1, Votes for option 0 (no), hence adds 1 vote.
- Voter 2: Weight = 2, Votes for option 1 (yes), hence adds 2 votes.
- Voter 3: Weight = 3, Votes for option 0 (no), hence adds 3 votes.
- Voter 4: Weight = 4, Votes for option 1 (yes), hence adds 4 votes.

The total census weight is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` and will be distributed among the choices.

The related code could be something like:

```ts
client.submitVote(new Vote([participantIndex % 2]));
```

## Results interpretation

The results from a weighted voting process are returned by the API as an array, which encapsulates the sum of the 
weighted votes cast for each choice. In the given example, the API will return the following array:

```
[ [ '4', '6' ] ]
```

In this type of election, where there's only one question with two possible choices, the array represents the summed 
weights of votes for each option. Here, each index in the array corresponds to an option from the voting question.

The value at each index is the total of weighted votes that the corresponding option received. For the first option (no), 
the total weighted votes are `1 (from voter 1) + 3 (from voter 3) = 4`, hence '4' at the first index of the array.

For the second option (yes), the total weighted votes are `2 (from voter 2) + 4 (from voter 4) = 6`, thus '6' at the 
second index.

The array `[ [ '4', '6' ] ]` encapsulates this result, which can be interpreted as "4 weighted votes for 'no' and 6 
weighted votes for 'yes'".
