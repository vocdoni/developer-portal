# Multi Choice

TODO

An election with a single choice result, is a voting system where each voter is typically allowed to cast only one vote
for their preferred option. Is the simplest allowed voting system. Let's see how to set up the SDK to use this kind of
voting system.

The single choice voting supports one or multiple questions.

See:

- [Ballot protocol implementation](/protocol/ballot#single-choice)

## Setting up the election

For this type of election it can be created with default parameters:

```ts
const election = Election.from({
  census,
  title: 'Do you like chocolate?',
  description: 'A simple survey to check how many people likes chocolate',
})
```

Once the election is created but not published, you have to add questions, where every choice has a unique value:

```ts
election.addQuestion('Do you like chocolate without milk?', 'This is the description', [
  {
    title: 'Yes',
    value: 0,
  },
  {
    title: 'No',
    value: 1,
  },
]).addQuestion('Do you like chocolate with milk', 'This is the description', [
  {
    title: 'Yes',
    value: 0,
  },
  {
    title: 'No',
    value: 1,
  },
  {
    title: 'Not  always',
    value: 2,
  },
])
```

:::info About choices values

Note that the values of the questions are **incremental** and the first value **must** be 0

:::tip Supports multiple questions

This election type supports multiple questions

:::

:::caution Not all elections type supports multiple questions!

This kind of election support multiple questions, but **not all the election types support this yet**! Check the
docs to see if the election you are creating supports multiple question.

:::

If you want to limit the maximum number of questions or values an election can have, you can play with `maxCount` and
`maxValue` parameters of the `voteOpts`:

```ts
const election_opts: IVoteType = {
    maxCount: 2, // Represents the max number of questions
    maxValue: 3, // Represents the max number of choices for a given question.
}
const election = Election.from({
  census,
  election_opts,
  //...
})
````

## Casting a vote

A vote can be cast using the method below:

```ts
client.submitVote(new Vote([0, 2]));
```

Every position on the vote array represents a question, and the value is the corresponding selected choice. On this case
we are selecting the first choice for the first question and the third choice for the second.


## Results interpretation

Consider a scenario where 10 voters cast identical votes, i.e., `[0, 2]`.

The election results would be represented as a two-dimensional array:

```
 [
   [ '10', '0', '0' ],
   [ '0', '0', '10' ]
 ]
```

Every inner array represents the results for a question, and every position of the inner array represents the votes that
a choice has received.

On the above example, question one has two choices and the second three. However, results array for the first question
are three because the `maxValue` for all questions is the same (in this case, 3, the `maxValue` of the question with
more choices).
