# CSP Blind Signatures

In contrast to the standard off-chain-tree census in which an anonymous proof can be generated in one step based off of a Merkle tree of voters, Credential service provider censuses require more interaction between voters and the CSP. With CSP voting, each voter needs to request a proof from the election CSP, providing personal information to generate this proof, and recieving a CSP signature that represents their eligibility. 

In order to preserve voter anonymity, the CSP server is equipped with the use of blind signatures. Blind signatures allow for the voter eligibility proof to be disconnected from the signature provided by the CSP, meaning that the operators of the CSP have no way to correlate a voter's personal information with their vote package. This is a simplified summary of the process; the technical implementation of blind signatures is available on [github](https://github.com/vocdoni/blind-csp) and documented [here](/protocol/census/off-chain-csp#blind-signatures).
