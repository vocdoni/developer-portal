# Anonymous Voting

- **Anonymous voting** is a type of voting process where the users can vote without revealing their identity, by proving that they are accepted as valid voters. Currently we have 2 types of *anonymous voting* schemes:
    - [Anonymous voting with **zk census proof**][zk-census-proof]: type of *anonymous voting* where the user proves their ability to vote through a zk census proof (franchise proof).
    - [Anonymous voting with **blind signatures**][blind-csp]: type of *anonymous voting* using blind signatures.
    - [Anonymous voting with **token-based census**][token-based]: an implementation of *anonymous voting* for on-chain token-based censuses.
