It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options.

It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census).
