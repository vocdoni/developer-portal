The price is determined by combining several components, each reflecting one specific aspect of the election process.\n\n1. **Base Price**: This is a fixed cost that serves as a starting point for the price calculation. It represents the minimal price for creating an election regardless of its size or duration.\n2. **Size Price**: As the number of voters (maxCensusSize) in an election increases, the resources required to manage the election also grow. To account for this, the size price component is directly proportional to the maximum number of votes allowed in the election. Additionally, it takes into consideration the blockchain's maximum capacity (capacity) and the maximum capacity the blockchain administrators can set (maxCapacity). This ensures that the price is adjusted based on the current capacity of the blockchain.\n3. **Duration Price**: The length of the election (electionDuration) also affects the price, as longer elections occupy more resources over time. The duration price component is directly proportional to the election duration and inversely proportional to the maximum number of votes. This means that if the election lasts longer, the price increases, and if there are more votes in a shorter time, the price also increases to reflect the higher demand for resources.\n4. **Encrypted Votes**: If an election requires encryption for maintaining secrecy until the end (encryptedVotes), it demands additional resources and computational effort. Therefore, the encrypted price component is added to the total price when this feature is enabled.\n5. **Anonymous Votes**: Similarly, if an election is anonymous (anonymousVotes), it requires additional measures to ensure voter privacy. As a result, the anonymous price component is added to the total price when this option is chosen.\n6. **Overwrite Price**: Allowing voters to overwrite their votes (maxVoteOverwrite) can increase the complexity of managing the election, as it requires additional resources to handle vote updates. The overwrite price component accounts for this by being proportional to the maximum number of vote overwrites and the maximum number of votes allowed in the election. It also takes into account the blockchain's capacity to ensure the price reflects the current resource constraints.\n\nThe constant factors in the price formula play a crucial role in determining the price of an election based on its characteristics. Each factor is associated with a specific component of the price formula and helps to weigh the importance of that component in the final price calculation. The rationale behind these constant factors is to provide a flexible mechanism to adjust the pricing model based on the system's needs and requirements.\n\n- **k1 (Size price factor)**: This constant factor affects the size price component of the formula. By adjusting k1, you can control the impact of the maximum number of votes (maxCensusSize) on the overall price. A higher k1 value would make the price increase more rapidly as the election size grows, while a lower k1 value would make the price less sensitive to the election size. The rationale behind k1 is to ensure that the pricing model can be adapted to accommodate different election sizes while considering the resource requirements.\n- **k2 (Duration price factor)**: This constant factor influences the duration price component of the formula. By adjusting k2, you can control how the duration of the election (electionDuration) affects the price. A higher k2 value would make the price increase more quickly as the election duration extends, while a lower k2 value would make the price less sensitive to the election duration. The rationale behind k2 is to reflect the resource consumption over time and ensure that longer elections are priced accordingly.\n- **k3 (Encrypted price factor)**: This constant factor affects the encrypted price component of the formula. By adjusting k3, you can control the additional cost associated with encrypted elections (encryptedVotes). A higher k3 value would make the price increase more significantly for elections that require encryption, while a lower k3 value would make the price less sensitive to the encryption requirement. The rationale behind k3 is to account for the extra computational effort and resources needed to ensure secrecy in encrypted elections.\n- **k4 (Anonymous price factor)**: This constant factor influences the anonymous price component of the formula. By adjusting k4, you can control the additional cost associated with anonymous elections (anonymousVotes). A higher k4 value would make the price increase more significantly for elections that require anonymity, while a lower k4 value would make the price less sensitive to the anonymity requirement. The rationale behind k4 is to account for the extra measures and resources needed to ensure voter privacy in anonymous elections.\n- **k5 (Overwrite price factor)**: This constant factor affects the overwrite price component of the formula. By adjusting k5, you can control the additional cost associated with allowing vote overwrites (maxVoteOverwrite). A higher k5 value would make the price increase more significantly for elections that permit vote overwrites, while a lower k5 value would make the price less sensitive to the overwrite allowance. The rationale behind k5 is to account for the increased complexity and resources needed to manage vote overwrites in the election process.\n- **k6 (Non-linear growth factor)**: This constant factor determines the rate of price growth for elections with a maximum number of votes (maxCensusSize) exceeding the k7 threshold. By adjusting k6, you can control the non-linear growth rate of the price for larger elections. A higher k6 value would result in a more rapid increase in the price as the election size grows beyond the k7 threshold, while a lower k6 value would result in a slower increase in the price for larger elections. The rationale behind k6 is to provide a mechanism for controlling the pricing model's sensitivity to large elections. This factor ensures that the price accurately reflects the increased complexity, resource consumption, and management effort associated with larger elections, while maintaining a more affordable price for smaller elections. By fine-tuning k6, the pricing model can be adapted to balance accessibility for smaller elections with the need to cover costs and resource requirements for larger elections.\n- **k7 (Size non-linear trigger)**: This constant factor represents a threshold value for the maximum number of votes (maxCensusSize) in an election. When the election size exceeds k7, the price growth becomes non-linear, increasing more rapidly beyond this point. The rationale behind k7 is to create a pricing model that accommodates a \"freemium\" approach, where smaller elections (under the k7 threshold) are priced affordably, while larger elections are priced more significantly due to their increased resource requirements and complexity. By adjusting k7, you can control the point at which the price transition from linear to non-linear growth occurs. A higher k7 value would allow for more affordable pricing for a larger range of election sizes, while a lower k7 value would result in more rapid price increases for smaller election sizes. This flexibility enables the pricing model to be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the Vocdoni blockchain, ensuring that small elections remain accessible and affordable,while larger elections are priced to reflect their higher resource demands.\n",method:"get",path:"/chain/info/electionPriceFactors",servers:[{url:"https://api-dev.vocdoni.net/v2"}],securitySchemes:{BasicAuth:{scheme:"basic",type:"http"}},info:{contact:{},description:"\nThe Vocdoni API is a REST API that substitutes the previous RPCs in order to make it easier for  developers/integrators to build on top of the voting protocol.

During this waiting period, the client can repeatedly query the endpoint until a  successful response with a status code of 200 is received, thereby avoiding any errors that may occur due to the transaction not being published yet.",title:"Vocdoni API",version:"2.0.0"},postman:{name:"Price factors information",description:{content:"Package electionprice provides a mechanism for calculating the price of an election based on its characteristics.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the price of creating an election on the Vocdoni blockchain is designed to take into account various factors that impact the computational cost and complexity of conducting an election. The price is determined by combining several components, each reflecting one specific aspect of the election process.\n\n1. **Base Price**: This is a fixed cost that serves as a starting point for the price calculation. It represents the minimal price for creating an election regardless of its size or duration.\n2. **Size Price**: As the number of voters (maxCensusSize) in an election increases, the resources required to manage the election also grow. To account for this, the size price component is directly proportional to the maximum number of votes allowed in the election. Additionally, it takes into consideration the blockchain's maximum capacity (capacity) and the maximum capacity the blockchain administrators can set (maxCapacity). This ensures that the price is adjusted based on the current capacity of the blockchain.\n3. **Duration Price**: The length of the election (electionDuration) also affects the price, as longer elections occupy more resources over time. The duration price component is directly proportional to the election duration and inversely proportional to the maximum number of votes. This means that if the election lasts longer, the price increases, and if there are more votes in a shorter time, the price also increases to reflect the higher demand for resources.\n4. **Encrypted Votes**: If an election requires encryption for maintaining secrecy until the end (encryptedVotes), it demands additional resources and computational effort. Therefore, the encrypted price component is added to the total price when this feature is enabled.\n5. **Anonymous Votes**: Similarly, if an election is anonymous (anonymousVotes), it requires additional measures to ensure voter privacy. As a result, the anonymous price component is added to the total price when this option is chosen.\n6. **Overwrite Price**: Allowing voters to overwrite their votes (maxVoteOverwrite) can increase the complexity of managing the election, as it requires additional resources to handle vote updates. The overwrite price component accounts for this by being proportional to the maximum number of vote overwrites and the maximum number of votes allowed in the election. It also takes into account the blockchain's capacity to ensure the price reflects the current resource constraints.\n\nThe constant factors in the price formula play a crucial role in determining the price of an election based on its characteristics. Each factor is associated with a specific component of the price formula and helps to weigh the importance of that component in the final price calculation. The rationale behind these constant factors is to provide a flexible mechanism to adjust the pricing model based on the system's needs and requirements.\n\n- **k1 (Size price factor)**: This constant factor affects the size price component of the formula. By adjusting k1, you can control the impact of the maximum number of votes (maxCensusSize) on the overall price. A higher k1 value would make the price increase more rapidly as the election size grows, while a lower k1 value would make the price less sensitive to the election size. The rationale behind k1 is to ensure that the pricing model can be adapted to accommodate different election sizes while considering the resource requirements.\n- **k2 (Duration price factor)**: This constant factor influences the duration price component of the formula. By adjusting k2, you can control how the duration of the election (electionDuration) affects the price. A higher k2 value would make the price increase more quickly as the election duration extends, while a lower k2 value would make the price less sensitive to the election duration. The rationale behind k2 is to reflect the resource consumption over time and ensure that longer elections are priced accordingly.\n- **k3 (Encrypted price factor)**: This constant factor affects the encrypted price component of the formula. By adjusting k3, you can control the additional cost associated with encrypted elections (encryptedVotes). A higher k3 value would make the price increase more significantly for elections that require encryption, while a lower k3 value would make the price less sensitive to the encryption requirement. The rationale behind k3 is to account for the extra computational effort and resources needed to ensure secrecy in encrypted elections.\n- **k4 (Anonymous price factor)**: This constant factor influences the anonymous price component of the formula. By adjusting k4, you can control the additional cost associated with anonymous elections (anonymousVotes). A higher k4 value would make the price increase more significantly for elections that require anonymity, while a lower k4 value would make the price less sensitive to the anonymity requirement. The rationale behind k4 is to account for the extra measures and resources needed to ensure voter privacy in anonymous elections.\n- **k5 (Overwrite price factor)**: This constant factor affects the overwrite price component of the formula. By adjusting k5, you can control the additional cost associated with allowing vote overwrites (maxVoteOverwrite). A higher k5 value would make the price increase more significantly for elections that permit vote overwrites, while a lower k5 value would make the price less sensitive to the overwrite allowance. The rationale behind k5 is to account for the increased complexity and resources needed to manage vote overwrites in the election process.\n- **k6 (Non-linear growth factor)**: This constant factor determines the rate of price growth for elections with a maximum number of votes (maxCensusSize) exceeding the k7 threshold. By adjusting k6, you can control the non-linear growth rate of the price for larger elections. A higher k6 value would result in a more rapid increase in the price as the election size grows beyond the k7 threshold, while a lower k6 value would result in a slower increase in the price for larger elections. The rationale behind k6 is to provide a mechanism for controlling the pricing model's sensitivity to large elections. This factor ensures that the price accurately reflects the increased complexity, resource consumption, and management effort associated with larger elections, while maintaining a more affordable price for smaller elections. By fine-tuning k6, the pricing model can be adapted to balance accessibility for smaller elections with the need to cover costs and resource requirements for larger elections.\n- **k7 (Size non-linear trigger)**: This constant factor represents a threshold value for the maximum number of votes (maxCensusSize) in an election. When the election size exceeds k7, the price growth becomes non-linear, increasing more rapidly beyond this point. The rationale behind k7 is to create a pricing model that accommodates a \"freemium\" approach, where smaller elections (under the k7 threshold) are priced affordably, while larger elections are priced more significantly due to their increased resource requirements and complexity. By adjusting k7, you can control the point at which the price transition from linear to non-linear growth occurs. A higher k7 value would allow for more affordable pricing for a larger range of election sizes, while a lower k7 value would result in more rapid price increases for smaller election sizes. This flexibility enables the pricing model to be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the Vocdoni blockchain, ensuring that small elections remain accessible and affordable,while larger elections are priced to reflect their higher resource demands.\n",type:"text/plain"},url:{path:["chain","info","electionPriceFactors"],host:["{{baseUrl}}"],query:[],variable:[]},header:[{key:"Accept",value:"application/json"}],method:"GET"}},sidebar_class_name:"get api-method",info_path:"vocdoni-api/vocdoni-api",custom_edit_url:null},sidebar:"defaultSidebar",previous:{title:"Circuit info",permalink:"/vocdoni-api/circuit-info"},next:{title:"List organizations",permalink:"/vocdoni-api/list-organizations"}},p={},f=[{value:"Price factors information",id:"price-factors-information",level:2}],g={toc:f};function y(e){let{components:t,...i}=e;return(0,n.kt)("wrapper",(0,o.Z)({},g,i,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"price-factors-information"},"Price factors information"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Package electionprice provides a mechanism for calculating the price of an election based on its characteristics."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The formula used to calculate the price of creating an election on the Vocdoni blockchain is designed to take into account various factors that impact the computational cost and complexity of conducting an election.
