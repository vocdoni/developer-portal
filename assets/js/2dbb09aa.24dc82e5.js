It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens, give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of options. To know more about the params of an election and its lifecycle go [here](../get-started/intro#23-elections). In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of the vote, consult your information and send a vote.\n- [**SIK**](sik): The Secret Identity Key is a user-generated piece of information that proves the user's identity without revealing it. It is the hash of the user's address, the signature of a public message and an optional secret part. It is used to ensure anonymous voting. All registered accounts or anonymous voters must register a SIK, and they are all stored in a Merkle tree. The `/siks` endpoints help to generate a proof of membership, get the current valid SIK roots, or check if an account has a valid SIK.\n\n\n### Errors \n\nBackend error messages list are defined here: https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-node/blob/master/api/errors.go\n\nAbout the **204 no content** error: this message will be returned only if the asset being queried cannot be found but no other errors have occurred.
