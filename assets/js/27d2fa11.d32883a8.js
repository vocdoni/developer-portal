It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options. To know more about the params of an election and its lifecycle go [here](../get-started/intro#23-elections).  In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},postman:{name:"Paginated organizations list",description:{content:"See [list organizations](organizations-list)\nIf no page is defined, will assume page 0",type:"text/plain"},url:{path:["chain","organizations","page",":page"],host:["{{baseUrl}}"],query:[],variable:[{disabled:!1,description:{content:"(Required) When returning a list it define de page number.
