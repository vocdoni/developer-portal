It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options. To know more about the params of an election and its lifecycle go [here](../get-started/intro#23-elections).  In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote.\n\nBackend error messages list are defined here: https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-node/blob/master/api/errors.go"},postman:{name:"Census size",description:{content:"Total number of keys added to the census. \n- Size as integer",type:"text/plain"},url:{path:["censuses",":censusId","size"],host:["{{baseUrl}}"],query:[],variable:[{disabled:!1,description:{content:"(Required) Census id provided during census creation",type:"text/plain"},type:"any",value:"",key:"censusId"}]},header:[{key:"Accept",value:"application/json"}],method:"GET"}},sidebar_class_name:"get api-method",info_path:"vocdoni-api/vocdoni-api",custom_edit_url:null},h=void 0,m={unversionedId:"vocdoni-api/census-size",id:"vocdoni-api/census-size",title:"Census size",description:"Total number of keys added to the census.",source:"@site/docs/vocdoni-api/census-size.api.mdx",sourceDirName:"vocdoni-api",slug:"/vocdoni-api/census-size",permalink:"/vocdoni-api/census-size",draft:!1,editUrl:null,tags:[],version:"current",frontMatter:{id:"census-size",title:"Census size",description:"Total number of keys added to the census.",sidebar_label:"Census size",hide_title:!0,hide_table_of_contents:!0,api:{description:"Total number of keys added to the census. \n- Size as integer",operationId:"censusSize",tags:["Censuses"],parameters:[{name:"censusId",in:"path",description:"Census id provided during census creation",required:!0,schema:{type:"string",description:"Random 32 bytes hex string",example:"b547a9c83ad7d61b568cf10ebbb25338d680810fa219fa69477cfbd860b386c2"}}],responses:{200:{description:"Size as integer",content:{"application/json":{schema:{type:"object",properties:{size:{type:"integer",format:"int32",example:1}}}}}}},method:"get",path:"/censuses/{censusId}/size",servers:[{url:"https://api-dev.vocdoni.net/v2/"}],securitySchemes:{bearerAuth:{type:"http",scheme:"bearer"}},info:{version:"2.0.0",title:"Vocdoni API",description:"The Vocdoni API is a REST API that substitutes the previous RPCs in order to make it easier for  developers/integrators to build on top of the voting protocol.
