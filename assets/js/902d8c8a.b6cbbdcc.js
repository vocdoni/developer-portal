It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options. To know more about the params of an election and its lifecycle go [here](../get-started/intro#23-elections).  In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote.\n\nBackend error messages list are defined here: https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-node/blob/master/api/errors.go"},postman:{name:"Calculate election price",description:{content:"Election Price API endpoint for calculating the price of an election.\n\nIt takes a JSON object with the 5 election parameters that are required for calculating the price.",type:"text/plain"},url:{path:["elections","price"],host:["{{baseUrl}}"],query:[],variable:[]},header:[{key:"Content-Type",value:"application/json"},{key:"Accept",value:"application/json"}],method:"GET",body:{mode:"raw",raw:'""',options:{raw:{language:"json"}}}}},sidebar_class_name:"get api-method",info_path:"vocdoni-api/vocdoni-api",custom_edit_url:null},m=void 0,u={unversionedId:"vocdoni-api/election-price",id:"vocdoni-api/election-price",title:"Calculate election price",description:"Election Price API endpoint for calculating the price of an election.",source:"@site/docs/vocdoni-api/election-price.api.mdx",sourceDirName:"vocdoni-api",slug:"/vocdoni-api/election-price",permalink:"/vocdoni-api/election-price",draft:!1,editUrl:null,tags:[],version:"current",frontMatter:{id:"election-price",title:"Calculate election price",description:"Election Price API endpoint for calculating the price of an election.",sidebar_label:"Calculate election price",hide_title:!0,hide_table_of_contents:!0,api:{description:"Election Price API endpoint for calculating the price of an election.\n\nIt takes a JSON object with the 5 election parameters that are required for calculating the price.",operationId:"electionPrice",tags:["Elections"],requestBody:{content:{"application/json":{schema:{type:"object",properties:{maxCensusSize:{type:"number",format:"int32",example:5e3},electionBlocks:{type:"number",format:"int32",example:158},encryptedVotes:{type:"boolean",example:!1},anonymousVotes:{type:"boolean",example:!1},maxVoteOverwrite:{type:"number",format:"int32",example:1}}}}}},responses:{200:{description:"It return a list of organizations id",content:{"application/json":{schema:{type:"object",properties:{price:{type:"number",format:"int32",example:61}}}}}}},method:"get",path:"/elections/price",servers:[{url:"https://api-dev.vocdoni.net/v2/"}],securitySchemes:{bearerAuth:{type:"http",scheme:"bearer"}},jsonRequestBodyExample:{maxCensusSize:5e3,electionBlocks:158,encryptedVotes:!1,anonymousVotes:!1,maxVoteOverwrite:1},info:{version:"2.0.0",title:"Vocdoni API",description:"The Vocdoni API is a REST API that substitutes the previous RPCs in order to make it easier for  developers/integrators to build on top of the voting protocol.
