It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options. To know more about the params of an election and its lifecycle go [here](../get-started/intro#23-elections).  In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"Prove key to census","description":{"content":"Prove the key and weight belong to the census root hash.\n\nIf the key exists on the census returns Merkle root information. `Proof` property is referred to the siblings \nof Merkle tree, the `value` points to the leaf of the Merkle Tree for this key (on this case, the weight), and\nweight is just the key weight for this census. \n\n[Further reading](https://docs.vocdoni.io/architecture/census/off-chain-tree.html)\n\n- Requires Bearer token \n- Returns a merkle proof, proving the key and weight belongs to the census root hash","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["censuses",":censusId","proof",":publicKey"],"host":["{{baseUrl}}"],"query":[],"variable":[{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"(Required) Census id provided during census creation","type":"text/plain"},"type":"any","value":"","key":"censusId"},{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"(Required) Wallet Public key or address","type":"text/plain"},"type":"any","value":"","key":"publicKey"}]},"header":[{"key":"Accept","value":"application/json"}],"method":"GET","auth":{"type":"bearer","bearer":[{"type":"any","value":"<Bearer Token>","key":"token"}]}}}

## Prove key to census



Prove the key and weight belong to the census root hash.

If the key exists on the census returns Merkle root information. `Proof` property is referred to the siblings 
of Merkle tree, the `value` points to the leaf of the Merkle Tree for this key (on this case, the weight), and
weight is just the key weight for this census.

- Requires Bearer token 
- Returns a merkle proof, proving the key and weight belongs to the census root hash
