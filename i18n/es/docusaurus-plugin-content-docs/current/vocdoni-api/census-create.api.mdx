It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options.

It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"Create new census","description":{"content":"Create a new census on the backend side.

## Create new census



Create a new census on the backend side. The census is still unpublished until [publish](census-publish) is 
called.  

To create the census it require a `Bearer token` created on the user side using a 
[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). This token **should we stored for the user 
to perform operations to this census** such add participants or publish.

It return a new random censusID (a random 32 bytes hex string), which are used (along with the Bearer token) to 
[add participant keys](census-add-participants) to the census. Once the census is published no more keys can be 
added.

To use a census on an election, it **must be published**.

- Available types are: `weighted` and `zkindexed`
- Require header Bearer token created user side
