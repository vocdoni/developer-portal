It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network based on Tendermint that  executes the Vocdoni Protocol logic represented as a state machine. Its main purpose is to register votes in a  decentralized and verifiable format. In those endpoints, you can consult the state of the chain, transactions costs,  list organizations and get more Vochain info.\n- [**Accounts**](accounts): Identified by an Ethereum like address. An account can create and manage elections, transfer tokens,  give power to other accounts on his behalf (delegates) and manage its metadata.\n- [**Elections**](elections): Is a rule-set of options and requirements for creating a process in which people vote a series of  options.

In this section you will find all information related to an election as its information, election keys, submitted  votes & how to create a new election.\n- [**Censuses**](censuses): The census is a key component of any voting process. It specifies the set of users (identified by a  public key or address) eligible for participating in an election. To understand more about the Censuses you can  check [here](../get-started/intro#21-the-census). Here you will be able to get censuses information like the Merkle  root, total weight & size, import/export the censuses and create new ones.\n- [**Votes**](votes): All the information related to the vote issued by a participant in a vote, you can check the validity of  the vote, consult your information and send a vote."},"postman":{"name":"Publish census","description":{"content":"Register a census to the storage (IPFS in our case).

## Publish census



Register a census to the storage (IPFS in our case). After this, the census can't be edited. 

You could provide the census Merkle root to specify census publication at specific snapshot. 
See [censuses/{censusId}/participants](census-add-participants)

- Requires Bearer token
- The census is copied to a new census identified by its Merkle Root
- The new census **cannot be modified**
- The census is published to the storage provided (IPFS in our case)
- The new census ID is returned and can be used for querying
- If a censusID with the same root has been already published, the request will fail
