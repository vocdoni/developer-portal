# developer-portal

This repository hosts the Vocdoni developer portal, the source-of-truth of technical documentation for all of the software under the Vocdoni umbrella. 
It is created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and is hosted at https://developer.vocdoni.io

## Getting Started

You can host the developer portal locally. The easiest way to do so is with the docusaurus development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can also build the site:
```bash
yarn build
```

You can locally deploy the site:
```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```
This will run `docusaurus deploy` which deploys whatever iteration of the site has been built in the `build/` folder. It will then push the build result to the remote `gh-pages` branch corresponding to the branch you are running the command from.


## Reference

There are multiple auto-generated documentation files that require generation.

### Generate the API documentation

The Vocdoni API documentation is sourced from the `swaggers` folder. If you modified the swagger file under `swaggers/` folder and want to build `.mdx` files again:

```bash
yarn run re-gen
```

Note that this docs generation step is already performed as part of `yarn start` or `yarn build`. 

### Generate the SDK documentation

If you want to generate the SDK documentation for yourself, you can do so from inside the `docs` directory in the `vocdoni-sdk` project. 

~~~bash
yarn
yarn build
~~~

This creates a temporary documentation folder `temp_docs`.
Then you can return to the developer-documentation directory and run the yarn script to replace the SDK reference folder, clean up some broken autogenerated links, and remove the temp_docs folder:

~~~bash
# Set the vocdoni sdk folder path
export VOCDONI_SDK_PATH=......
yarn copy-sdk-docs
~~~

Note that the SDK docs are tracked by git, and you should not need to do this if you are not a repo maintainer.


### Translations

We integrated crowdin for translations. Use:

```bash
yarn crowdin:upload
```

To upload translations to crowdin. There you can translate the files and then download them using:

```bash
yarn crowdin:download
```

This will download translation files to the `i18n/` folder. To test them use `yarn start -- --locale es`.

See these issues [1](https://community.crowdin.com/t/exclude-single-line-on-markdown-headers/2897), 
[2](https://community.crowdin.com/t/broken-mdx-components-on-download/2912) to understand why the `pre`/`post` scripts 
on crowdin download and upload. 


## Contributing 

While we welcome contributions from the community, we do not track all of our issues on Github and we may not have the resources to onboard developers and review complex pull requests. That being said, there are multiple ways you can get involved with the project. 

Please review our [development guidelines](https://developer.vocdoni.io/development-guidelines).
